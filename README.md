# Plague-Inc

## Ideas
High Prio:
* specific virus start pattern instead of single tile
  * meaningful patterns
* airplane lines for infecting islands with no intial virus
* performance optimization for seaMatrix-creation

Medium Prio:
* resize doesn't break ui
* continent specific resistance
* stat buff system for virus, e.g. virus spreading probability, dying probability
* human buffs, masks, school closure

Low Prio:
* different game map -> single country maps (Europe, Germany)
* different virus variations
